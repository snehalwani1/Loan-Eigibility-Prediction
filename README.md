# Loan-Eigibility-Prediction

## Introduction:

The project aims to automate the loan eligibility process by predicting whether a customer is eligible for a loan based on their application details.

## Problem Statement:

To develop a model that predicts loan eligibility using historical loan application data. This involves identifying missing criteria and understanding factors affecting loan approval.

## Aim:

To build and evaluate a machine learning model to predict loan eligibility and identify significant factors influencing loan approval

## Technologies Used:


**Python Libraries**: NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn


**Modeling**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest


**Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, pickle for model saving
